4. Set Up Proxy SwitchySharp Rules
Proxy SwitchySharp allows you to set up rules to automatically switch between proxy profiles based on the websites you visit. This is useful for using different proxies for different sites.

Here’s how to set up rules:

<li>A. Open the Rules Tab</li>
In the Proxy SwitchySharp settings page, navigate to the “Auto Switch” tab.

<li>B. Create a New Rule</li>
Click “Add Rule” to create a new rule. You can specify conditions such as:

Use a specific proxy profile for all traffic.
Automatically switch to a different proxy when visiting certain websites.

<li>C. Set Rule Conditions</li>
Configure the conditions for the rule. For example:

<li>Use a specific proxy for a specific domain (e.g., example.com).</li>
<li>Switch to another proxy when accessing a geo-restricted website.</li>

<li>D. Save the Rule</li>
After configuring the conditions, click “Save.” Proxy SwitchySharp will now apply these rules, automatically switching proxy profiles based on the sites you visit. You can create multiple rules for different browsing scenarios, ensuring the correct proxy is always used.

5. Test Your Proxy Setup
After setting up proxy profiles and rules, it’s important to test everything to make sure it’s functioning correctly.

<li>A. Test Individual Profiles</li>
Visit various websites while manually selecting the proxy profiles you've created in Proxy SwitchySharp. Verify that your IP address changes according to the proxy you selected. You can use websites like WhatIsMyIP.com to check your IP address.

<li>B. Test Auto Switch Rules</li>
Visit different websites and see if the rules you set up automatically switch to the correct proxy profile. If it’s not working, double-check the conditions in your rules to ensure they’re configured properly.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and manage Proxy SwitchySharp to meet your proxy-switching needs for secure and efficient browsing.
